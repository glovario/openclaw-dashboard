# OpenClaw Dashboard — Brand Proposal
*by Bard, 2026-02-15*

## 🏷️ Name Options

---

### 1. **Clawboard**
> *"Where claws meet clarity."*

A tight portmanteau of Claw + Board. Feels native to the OpenClaw ecosystem, instantly understood by the team, and has just enough silliness in the word "claw" to keep it friendly. It's also short enough to work as a logo wordmark without squishing.

**Logo concept:** A simple geometric crab/lobster claw shape — two curved lines forming a pincer — with a tiny task-list grid tucked inside the grip. Think flat icon, 2-colour, no gradients. Mason could build it in ~10 SVG paths.

---

### 2. **The Huddle**
> *"Human and agents, one tab."*

Warm, casual, human. A "huddle" is what you do before a game — quick sync, shared goals, then off you go. It frames the dashboard as a *meeting point* rather than a control panel, which fits the collaborative vibe perfectly. Slightly unexpected for a productivity tool, which makes it stick.

**Logo concept:** Three overlapping circles (like a Venn diagram but cozier) — one slightly larger for Matt, two smaller for agents. Flat, friendly colours. Think bubbly, not corporate org-chart.

---

### 3. **Switchboard**
> *"All the signals, none of the noise."*

Old-school telephone switchboard energy — the place where connections get made. Nods to coordination without taking itself seriously. Has a retro-quirky charm that feels right for a team with names like Atlas and Bard. Also: "switch" implies agency and control, which is reassuring.

**Logo concept:** A simple 3×3 grid of dots with a single curved connector line arcing between two of them — like a circuit trace or an old phone jack. Minimal, slightly technical, oddly satisfying. Monoline SVG, very buildable.

## 🎨 Colour Palette

Evolved from Bootstrap blue but warmer and more characterful. Friendly without being a children's toy.

| Role       | Name          | Hex       | Notes                                  |
|------------|---------------|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| Primary    | Reef Blue     | `#3B82C4` | Warmer than Bootstrap's `#0d6efd`, less clinical |
| Accent     | Tangerine     | `#F97316` | Punchy, friendly, great for CTAs and badges |
| Background | Off-White     | `#F8F7F4` | Warmer than pure white, easier on the eyes |
| Surface    | Pale Slate    | `#F1F3F6` | Cards, sidebars — just barely there    |
| Text       | Ink           | `#1E2A3A` | Dark navy, softer than pure black      |
| Muted      | Storm Grey    | `#8A99AC` | Secondary labels, timestamps           |

> **Why tangerine?** It's the opposite of "corporate SaaS blue". One warm accent makes the whole palette feel alive without going garish. Use it sparingly — badges, active states, key actions.

## 🔤 Typography

**[Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito)** — Google Fonts, free, beautiful.

Rounded terminals, warm personality, excellent legibility at small sizes. Feels approachable without being childish. Works great for both headings and body text, so you can get away with one font family across the whole UI. The semi-bold weight (600) hits a sweet spot for UI labels.

> *Alternative if Nunito feels too soft:* **[DM Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/DM+Sans)** — slightly more neutral, still friendly.

---

## 🤔 Recommendation

If I had to pick one: **Clawboard**. It's the most native to the OpenClaw world, the team will use it naturally in conversation ("check Clawboard"), and the logo concept is distinctive without requiring artistic skill from Mason. The claw motif also gives every sub-page and feature a visual language to build on.
