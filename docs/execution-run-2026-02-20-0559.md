# Execution Run — 2026-02-20 05:59 Europe/London

Scope: all tasks currently in `in-progress`.

## Concrete advancement completed this run

### OC-142 — WhatsApp plugin/channel drift
- Re-validated live gateway config (`gateway.config.get`):
  - `plugins.entries.whatsapp.enabled=false`
  - no `channels.whatsapp` object
  - no WhatsApp binding in `bindings[]`
- Re-validated cron inventory (`cron.list includeDisabled=true`): no job delivery targets use WhatsApp.
- Result: drift condition is no longer present; remediation criteria satisfied and ready for approval/closure.

### OC-116 — token contract/spec lock
- Confirmed and packaged contract artifacts are present and current for downstream teams:
  - `docs/token-reporting/spec-addendum.md`
  - `docs/token-reporting/reports-response.schema.json`
  - `docs/token-reporting/contract-fixtures.json`
- Branch artifact for implementation/spec work remains:
  - `chore/oc-116-token-contract-schema`

### OC-117/118/119/120/121 + parent OC-036 — unblock packet issued
- Published explicit owner-ordered unblock sequence to prevent circular waiting:
  1. **Ada (OC-116)** freeze contract + acceptance checklist (final sign-off checkpoint)
  2. **Mason (OC-117)** align persistence/ingestion fields to frozen contract
  3. **Malik (OC-118)** finalize `/api/reports/tokens` aggregates to contract
  4. **Juno (OC-119)** wire Reports tab against stabilized API payload
  5. **Quinn (OC-120)** run reconciliation + regression evidence
  6. **Elias (OC-121)** finish semantics/runbook docs with final payload examples
- Next unblock expectation: OC-116 sign-off posted, then OC-117/118 can advance immediately.

## ETA guidance used in task comments
- OC-142: move to `for-approval` now.
- OC-116: final sign-off + PR draft within 2–4 hours.
- OC-117 + OC-118: start same day after OC-116 sign-off; first implementation commit within 4 hours of unblock.
- OC-119 + OC-120 + OC-121: within 4–8 hours after OC-118 API contract confirmation.
- OC-036 parent: should remain blocked until at least OC-118 + OC-119 are no longer blocked.
