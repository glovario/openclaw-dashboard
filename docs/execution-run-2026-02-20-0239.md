# Execution-first run (2026-02-20 02:39 Europe/London)

Scope: all tasks currently in `in-progress` from dashboard API.

## Concrete advancement actions completed now

1. Posted fresh **progress comments** on every in-progress task with:
   - status snapshot
   - explicit blocker
   - dependency owner
   - next unblock step
   - ETA
   - PR/branch reference where available

2. Ran token reporting contract regression harness to validate currently linked artifact:
   - `npm run test:reports-contract` ✅ pass

3. Attempted to backfill `github_url` traceability fields directly via `PATCH /api/tasks/:id`.
   - Result: blocked by OC-141 guard because these tasks are already `in-progress` while owner heartbeats are stale.
   - This is now explicitly documented as a platform blocker for overnight execution runs.

## Task-by-task update notes

- **OC-142**: implementation artifact linked in comment (PR #49). Blocked on policy choice (reactivate WhatsApp plugin vs remove WhatsApp bindings).
- **OC-116**: contract/spec artifact linked in comment (PR #56). Awaiting Ada sign-off on edge-case semantics.
- **OC-117**: progress comment posted with explicit dependency on OC-116 contract lock and owner action path.
- **OC-118**: progress comment posted; explicit blocker = no active backend branch attached in current pass.
- **OC-119**: progress comment posted; linked existing implementation artifact (PR #46), remaining parity depends on OC-118.
- **OC-120**: progress comment posted; QA execution blocked until OC-118 payload is stable.
- **OC-121**: progress comment posted; docs finalization blocked on OC-118 + OC-120.
- **OC-036 (parent)**: parent progress comment posted with consolidated dependency chain.

## New blocker surfaced

`PATCH /api/tasks/:id` for metadata-only updates is currently blocked by owner-presence enforcement whenever task status is `in-progress`, even when status/owner are unchanged.

**Impact:** overnight execution bots cannot update `github_url` traceability on active tasks unless each assignee has a fresh presence heartbeat.

**Recommended next step:** Atlas/Ada decide whether OC-141 should exempt metadata-only updates (e.g., `github_url`, `tags`) from in-progress presence checks.
