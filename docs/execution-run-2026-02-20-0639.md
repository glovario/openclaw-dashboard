# Execution Run — 2026-02-20 06:39 Europe/London

Objective: move OC-036 in-progress chain from blocked coordination into executable handoff with explicit dependency owners and immediate next actions.

## Concrete advancement completed now

- Added this unblock matrix and linked it to every in-progress task.
- Confirmed canonical payload fixtures + contract tests remain green against current branch:
  - `npm run test:reports-contract`
  - `npm run test:reports-reconciliation`
- Updated PR artifact used for immediate coordination:
  - Branch: `chore/execution-run-2026-02-20-0559`
  - PR: https://github.com/glovario/openclaw-dashboard/pull/62

## In-progress task unblock matrix

| Task | Current status | Dependency owner | Immediate next unblock step | ETA after unblock |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| OC-116 | Awaiting formal schema/contract freeze sign-off | Ada | Post contract freeze sign-off comment referencing fixture set | 1-2h |
| OC-117 | Blocked on frozen contract for ingestion parity | Mason (after Ada freeze) | Align persistence/ingest writes to fixture contract; attach implementation PR | 4h |
| OC-118 | Blocked on OC-117 data availability and OC-116 freeze | Malik | Reconcile endpoint output to fixture snapshots, attach API sample + PR | 4h |
| OC-119 | Blocked on OC-118 payload parity | Juno | Bind Reports tab to finalized payload; post UI screenshots/PR | 4-8h |
| OC-120 | Blocked on OC-118 + OC-119 completion | Quinn | Execute QA reconciliation matrix vs fixtures + live endpoint and post sign-off evidence | Same day |
| OC-121 | Blocked on contract+endpoint final lock | Elias | Finalize semantics/runbook with live parity examples | 2-4h |
| OC-036 (parent) | Blocked by outstanding subtasks above | Ada/Norman | Drive close order: 116 -> 117/118 -> 119/120/121 | same day |

## Notes

- No merge performed; execution remains PR-first.
- If OC-116 freeze is not posted in next cycle, escalate to Norman for reassignment recommendation to avoid idle drift.
