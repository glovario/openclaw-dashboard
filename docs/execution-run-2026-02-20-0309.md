# Execution Run — 2026-02-20 03:09 Europe/London

## Scope
Execution-first advancement pass for all `in-progress` tasks: OC-142, OC-116, OC-117, OC-118, OC-119, OC-120, OC-121, OC-036.

## Concrete actions completed

### 1) OC-142 (WhatsApp plugin/channel drift)
- Pulled live OpenClaw config via `gateway config.get`.
- Verified `plugins.entries.whatsapp.enabled=true` (no longer disabled).
- Pulled active cron definitions and confirmed delivery routing is currently Telegram announce mode for active jobs.
- Result: original mismatch condition appears remediated; no risky config patch applied.

### 2) OC-036 stream unblock artifact
- Created this runbook with explicit dependency owner map and immediate unblock steps for each OC-036 subtask.
- Added concrete owner handoff sequence to enable same-day progress without waiting on status churn.

## Dependency owner map (current)
- **OC-116 (Ada)**: no blockers; upstream schema contract gate for OC-117/118/121/123.
- **OC-117 (Mason)**: blocked by OC-116.
- **OC-118 (Malik)**: blocked by OC-116 + OC-117.
- **OC-119 (Juno)**: blocked by OC-118.
- **OC-120 (Quinn)**: blocked by OC-118 + OC-119.
- **OC-121 (Elias)**: blocked by OC-116 + OC-118.
- **OC-036 parent (Ada)**: blocked by all subtask completion.

## Immediate unblock sequence
1. **Ada (OC-116)** publishes final contract (table fields, attribution rules, `/api/reports/tokens` response shape).
2. **Mason (OC-117)** implements ingestion persistence strictly to OC-116 contract.
3. **Malik (OC-118)** ships aggregation endpoint + tests against OC-116/117 outputs.
4. **Juno (OC-119)** binds Reports tab to OC-118 contract.
5. **Quinn (OC-120)** runs reconciliation/regression after OC-118 and OC-119 merge.
6. **Elias (OC-121)** finalizes semantics/runbook once OC-116 and OC-118 are stable.
