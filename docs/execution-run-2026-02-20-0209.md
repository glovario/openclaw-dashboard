# Execution-first run — 2026-02-20 02:09 Europe/London

## Scope
All tasks currently in `in-progress` at run start:
- OC-142
- OC-116
- OC-120
- OC-119
- OC-118
- OC-117
- OC-121
- OC-036

## Concrete advancement actions taken now

### 1) Runtime/config verification for OC-142
- Ran:
  - `node scripts/check-whatsapp-binding-drift.js /home/matt/.openclaw/openclaw.json`
- Result:
  - `ok: true`
  - `pluginEnabled: true`
  - `whatsappBindingCount: 0`
  - no drift detected.
- Advancement:
  - Confirms remediation state is still clean and not regressed.

### 2) Contract/aggregation validation for OC-036 stream (OC-116/117/118/119/120/121)
- Ran:
  - `API_KEY=*** node scripts/validate-token-reports.js`
- Result:
  - Contract checks pass for windows 7/30/90 and `include_unlinked=false`.
  - Current dataset has `events=0`, so reconciliation shape is valid but non-zero correctness evidence remains pending.
- Advancement:
  - Confirms endpoint contract is stable on current main; identifies precise remaining gap (seeded data + reconciliation assertions).

### 3) PR artifact for this execution pass
- Created branch:
  - `chore/execution-pass-2026-02-20-0209`
- Added this execution evidence file to track per-task action, blocker owner, and next unblock step.

## Per-task status/blocker/ETA/next step

### OC-142 — Fix WhatsApp plugin/channel binding drift
- Status: advanced (runtime verification completed this run).
- Blocker: none detected in current config/runtime.
- ETA: ready for owner review now.
- Branch/PR: `feat/oc-142-whatsapp-binding-remediation` / PR #49 (existing), plus this evidence branch.

### OC-116 — Finalize token usage schema + attribution contract
- Status: advanced (contract validator rerun; schema docs exist on main).
- Blocker: task metadata `github_url` update can fail when assignee heartbeat guard blocks PATCH attempts under owner binding policy.
- Dependency owner: Atlas (owner-presence binding policy/agent heartbeat path).
- Next unblock step: patch task metadata via active bound owner session OR temporarily use `github_url: N/A` where policy allows, then reapply PR URL.
- ETA: 2–4h after owner-presence metadata patch path confirmed.
- Branch/PR: `oc-116-token-schema-contract` / PR #54 (existing).

### OC-117 — Token usage persistence + ingestion path
- Status: partially advanced earlier; currently blocked for acceptance chain.
- Blocker: needs architecture contract lock alignment + seeded reconciliation evidence before downstream sign-off.
- Dependency owner: Ada (contract lock), Malik (aggregation acceptance), Quinn (QA reconciliation).
- Next unblock step: seed non-zero token events and attach reconciliation output to this task thread.
- ETA: 4–8h after non-zero dataset seeded.
- Branch/PR: `chore/oc-036-142-execution-pass-2026-02-20` / PR #52 includes ingestion evidence.

### OC-118 — /api/reports/tokens aggregation endpoint
- Status: advanced via validator pass this run.
- Blocker: non-zero dataset reconciliation proof not yet attached in task comments.
- Dependency owner: Malik.
- Next unblock step: run `scripts/seed-token-usage-events.js` then rerun validator and include by_agent/by_task/by_model spot-check output.
- ETA: 2–3h.
- Branch/PR: `main` contains endpoint; PR artifact references include #52/#50.

### OC-119 — Reports tab UI
- Status: implementation present on main; advanced indirectly by endpoint contract validation this run.
- Blocker: UI acceptance screenshots/regression checklist missing in task thread.
- Dependency owner: Juno.
- Next unblock step: capture screenshots for empty/non-empty/error states and attach to task comment.
- ETA: 2h once seeded data available.
- Branch/PR: main includes `client/src/components/ReportsTab.jsx`; prior artifacts #52/#50.

### OC-120 — QA reconciliation + regression suite
- Status: advanced by executing validator script this run.
- Blocker: QA sign-off requires non-zero data reconciliation and UI checks (currently zero-event pass only).
- Dependency owner: Quinn.
- Next unblock step: execute QA plan against seeded dataset and post pass/fail matrix.
- ETA: 3–5h after data seeding.
- Branch/PR: QA plan docs present on main; this branch adds fresh execution evidence.

### OC-121 — Documentation for token metrics semantics + runbook
- Status: docs exist on main; advanced by reconfirming live contract behavior this run.
- Blocker: docs need one final “known limitations (zero-event window)” note tied to QA output.
- Dependency owner: Elias.
- Next unblock step: append reconciliation caveat + troubleshooting note after Quinn’s QA evidence lands.
- ETA: <2h after QA comment is posted.
- Branch/PR: docs present on main; execution artifact in this branch.

### OC-036 (parent)
- Status: advanced (all stream tasks touched with concrete run evidence).
- Blocker: remaining chain is data seeding -> reconciliation QA -> final parent roll-up comment.
- Dependency owner: Norman (orchestration), Quinn (QA sign-off), Ada (final architecture acceptance), Malik (data/aggregation evidence).
- Next unblock step: dispatch sequenced closeout run in this order: OC-117 seed → OC-118 validate → OC-120 QA sign-off → OC-036 parent summary.
- ETA: same working block (6–10h) if owner handoffs occur without delay.

## Notes
- No merge to main performed in this run.
- This is an execution artifact PR candidate to preserve an auditable advancement trail.
