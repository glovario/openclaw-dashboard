## In-progress task action matrix

| Task | Action taken this run | Status | Blocker / dependency owner | Next unblock step | ETA |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| OC-036.1 (Task 118) | Re-validated contract behavior via unified suite (includes contract assertions) | Advancing | None hard; waiting only for Ada sign-off wording lock | Ada to confirm final contract text in task comment and pin schema hash | 2-4h |
| OC-036.2 (Task 119) | Ingestion path regression exercised in suite (ingest + dedupe checks) | Advancing | Depends on Mason to confirm production ingest hook wiring path | Mason to link ingest source path/entrypoint in code comment + task update | 2-4h |
| OC-036.3 (Task 120) | Aggregation parity exercised by reconciliation script and suite | Advancing | None hard; payload is test-covered but awaits owner acceptance | Malik to attach endpoint sample payload from local run and mark ready | 2-4h |
| OC-036.4 (Task 121) | UI dependency clarified against stabilized payload fixtures | Blocked | Dependency: Malik (OC-036.3) final payload acceptance + Juno UI bind pass | Juno to bind final UI cards/tables and post screenshot/proof once payload accepted | 4-8h |
| OC-036.5 (Task 122) | Delivered executable QA artifact (`test:reports-suite`) | Advancing | Dependency: Quinn to run against staging-like DB snapshot | Quinn to execute suite + record reconciliation evidence in QA comment | 4-8h |
| OC-036.6 (Task 123) | Docs/runbook already present; aligned with new suite command | Advancing | Dependency: Elias to add final operator usage snippet | Elias to include `test:reports-suite` in runbook verification section | 2-4h |
| OC-036 parent (Task 36) | Updated branch/PR artifact and cross-task unblock matrix | Advancing | Critical path: OC-036.3 acceptance → OC-036.4 UI finalization → OC-036.5 QA sign-off | Ada to drive parent-level coordination and move children toward for-approval with progress comments | 8-16h |
