Scope: all tasks currently in `in-progress` on dashboard API.

## Actions executed in this run

### OC-142 — Fix WhatsApp plugin/channel binding drift
- **Concrete action:** re-validated live in-progress inventory and confirmed remediation PR artifact linkage.
- **Artifact:** PR #49 (`feat/oc-142-whatsapp-binding-remediation`) as implementation branch for config drift guard.
- **Next unblock:** Atlas to apply/reconcile runtime gateway config state to match chosen policy (reactivate plugin OR fully remove whatsapp bindings/jobs), then rerun affected cron jobs.

### OC-116 — Finalize token usage schema + attribution contract
- **Concrete action:** validated existing contract/spec artifacts and promoted canonical PR link for this task.
- **Artifact:** PR #54 (`oc-116-token-schema-contract`) as canonical contract artifact.
- **Next unblock:** Ada to finalize acceptance checklist in PR and mark OC-116 ready for approval.

### OC-117 — Implement token usage persistence + ingestion path
- **Concrete action:** dependency chain rechecked and explicit unblock sequencing documented.
- **Artifact:** dependency on OC-116 confirmed; implementation should branch from `feat/oc-036-token-reporting-foundation` after contract lock.
- **Next unblock:** Mason to implement migration + ingestion hook immediately after OC-116 sign-off.

### OC-118 — Build `/api/reports/tokens` aggregation endpoint
- **Concrete action:** endpoint dependency preflight verified.
- **Artifact:** task remains blocked by OC-116 + OC-117; existing endpoint scaffolding present in `src/routes/reports.js`.
- **Next unblock:** Malik to complete aggregation contract tests and performance checks once OC-117 lands.

### OC-119 — Reports tab UI
- **Concrete action:** UI dependency preflight verified.
- **Artifact:** blocked by OC-118 API contract stability.

### OC-120 — QA reconciliation + regression suite
- **Concrete action:** QA dependency gate verified.
- **Artifact:** blocked by OC-118 + OC-119 completion.
- **Next unblock:** Quinn to execute reconciliation matrix and sign-off evidence once API/UI stabilize.

### OC-121 — Documentation for token metrics semantics + runbook
