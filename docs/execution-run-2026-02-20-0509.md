# Execution Run — 2026-02-20 05:09 Europe/London

## Concrete advancement actions

### OC-142
- Re-validated current gateway state: `plugins.entries.whatsapp.enabled=false` and telegram-only bindings.
- Re-validated cron inventory (`cron.list includeDisabled=true`): no remaining jobs configured to deliver via WhatsApp.
- Advancement artifact: this run confirms migration guardrails are holding and closes the config-drift verification loop pending Atlas runtime verification.

### OC-116 / OC-117 / OC-118 / OC-119 / OC-120 / OC-121 / OC-036

  - OC-119 frontend binding against stable payloads
  - OC-120 QA reconciliation and regression scenarios
  - OC-121 docs examples consistency
