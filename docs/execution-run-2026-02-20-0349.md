# Execution-first run (2026-02-20 03:49 Europe/London)

Scope: all tasks currently in `in-progress` from dashboard API.

## Concrete advancement actions completed now

1. Re-validated OC-142 environment state directly from live gateway config + cron registry:
   - `plugins.entries.whatsapp.enabled=false` confirmed.
   - No active WhatsApp channel/account bindings in config.
   - No active cron jobs delivering to WhatsApp.
   - Conclusion: current blocker is decision/documentation cleanup, not active runtime breakage.

2. Re-ran token reporting contract harness for OC-036 chain:
   - `npm run test:reports-contract` ✅ pass.

3. Built an explicit unblock matrix for every in-progress task (owner + next step + ETA) and posted progress comments on each task.

4. Confirmed metadata update blocker remains active:
   - `PATCH /api/tasks/:id` cannot update `github_url` while owner-presence gate marks in-progress assignee inactive.

## Task-by-task execution notes

- **OC-142**: validated no active WhatsApp delivery path remains; action now is policy closure (remove stale remediation language or formalize plugin re-enable path).
- **OC-116**: spec addendum and contract test remain healthy; awaiting Ada lock on final semantics before downstream implementation unblocks.
- **OC-117**: blocked on OC-116 semantic lock + owner-presence gate preventing metadata updates from overnight runner.
- **OC-118**: blocked on OC-117 persistence layer; no safe endpoint finalization until ingestion contract is merged.
- **OC-119**: UI parity remains blocked on OC-118 payload stabilization.
- **OC-120**: regression execution blocked on stable OC-118 payload and OC-119 final UI state.
- **OC-121**: final docs blocked pending OC-118+OC-120 completion evidence.
- **OC-036**: parent remains blocked by subtask chain; no safe closure action this run.

## Escalations raised this run

1. **Owner-presence gating vs overnight automation** (platform):
   - prevents attaching PR/branch metadata to in-progress tasks.
   - recommendation: allow metadata-only PATCH (`github_url`,`tags`) even when owner is offline.

2. **OC-142 status drift** (task hygiene):
   - runtime mismatch appears already neutralized, but task still lacks closure criteria update.
