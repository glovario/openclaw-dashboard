# Execution-first run — 2026-02-20 04:49 Europe/London

Branch: `fix/oc-036-report-filters-contract-alignment`

## Concrete actions taken in this run

- Added drift audit utility: `scripts/check-openclaw-config-drift.js`.
- Ran drift audit against live config:
  - `node scripts/check-openclaw-config-drift.js`
  - Result: `ok: true`, no active whatsapp plugin/channel/binding mismatch in current `openclaw.json`.
- Re-ran token report contract test suite:
  - `npm run test:reports-contract`
  - Result: pass.

## Task-by-task advancement

### OC-142 — WhatsApp plugin/channel binding drift
- Advancement: implemented reusable drift checker script and executed it on live config.
- Current state: mismatch not present now; indicates either prior transient config or already remediated state.
- Blocker: decision still required from **Atlas** on target-state policy for whatsapp (explicitly retired vs reactivated with account checks) to close the task cleanly.
- Next unblock step: Atlas to post policy decision and either (a) remove legacy whatsapp references from cron docs/jobs, or (b) re-enable plugin intentionally with connectivity test evidence.

### OC-116 — Token schema + attribution contract
- Advancement: validated current spec+contract implementation by re-running endpoint contract tests successfully.
- Current state: spec addendum appears implemented and test-backed.
- Next unblock step: Ada to publish final sign-off note and move to for-approval with traceability link.

### OC-117 — Token usage persistence + ingestion
- Advancement: re-validated ingest path and dedupe behavior through contract tests (`/api/reports/tokens/events`).
- Current state: table/index + ingestion + dedupe path passing test.
- Next unblock step: Mason to add a brief implementation note linking migration/table/index evidence, then for-approval.

### OC-118 — `/api/reports/tokens` aggregation endpoint
- Advancement: endpoint outputs validated through automated contract tests (filters/groupings/linked vs unlinked).
- Blocker dependency owner: **Ada + Mason** (formal confirmation OC-116/117 accepted).
- Next unblock step: after OC-116 + OC-117 for-approval, Malik posts perf/query note + moves OC-118 to for-approval.

### OC-119 — Reports tab UI
- Advancement: dependency state clarified and linked to passing backend contract test run.
- Blocker dependency owner: **Malik** (OC-118 payload freeze).
- Next unblock step: Juno bind final loading/empty/error polish against frozen payload and attach screenshots/PR.

### OC-120 — QA reconciliation + regression suite
- Advancement: test suite re-executed now, producing fresh pass evidence.
- Blocker dependency owner: **Juno + Malik** (stable UI + endpoint changes complete).
- Next unblock step: Quinn executes full reconciliation matrix once OC-118/119 marked ready.

### OC-121 — Docs semantics + runbook
- Advancement: dependency chain and readiness clarified; existing runbook/spec artifacts confirmed present.
- Blocker dependency owner: **Ada + Malik** (contract final + endpoint final).
- Next unblock step: Elias finalize docs pass only after OC-116/118 acceptance to avoid churn.

### OC-036 (parent)
- Advancement: refreshed execution evidence and blocker ownership map for all subtasks.
- Blocker: parent remains gated on subtasks 116–121 completion path.
- Next unblock step: Norman sequence acceptance in order 116 -> 117 -> 118 -> 119 -> 120/121, then move parent for approval.
