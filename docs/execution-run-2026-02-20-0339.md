# Execution Run — 2026-02-20 03:39 Europe/London

## Scope
Execution-first advancement pass across all in-progress tasks (OC-142, OC-116, OC-117, OC-118, OC-119, OC-120, OC-121, OC-036).

## Concrete actions taken now

1. Queried live dashboard in-progress queue and dependency graph.
2. Validated live OpenClaw config + cron jobs for OC-142 remediation state.
3. Created this run artifact on branch `chore/execution-run-2026-02-20-0321`.
4. Posted fresh progress comments to every in-progress task including:
   - status
   - blocker
   - dependency owner
   - next unblock step
   - ETA
   - branch/trace artifact
5. Updated task traceability links to this branch artifact where empty.

## Key findings

### OC-142 (WhatsApp drift)
- `plugins.entries.whatsapp.enabled=false` remains in config.
- No active WhatsApp channel/binding is present in current live config.
- Active cron jobs are delivering via Telegram/announce.
- Result: original drift condition appears neutralized; no risky config patch applied during this run.

### OC-036 stream blockers (current chain)
- OC-116 (Ada) is the upstream contract gate.
- OC-117 (Mason) depends on OC-116.
- OC-118 (Malik) depends on OC-116 + OC-117.
- OC-119 (Juno) depends on OC-118.
- OC-120 (Quinn) depends on OC-118 + OC-119.
- OC-121 (Elias) depends on OC-116 + OC-118.
- OC-036 parent remains blocked until all subtasks clear.

## Immediate unblock order
1. Ada finalizes OC-116 contract freeze.
2. Mason finalizes OC-117 ingestion path against frozen contract.
3. Malik finalizes OC-118 endpoint and contract tests.
4. Juno completes OC-119 UI bind.
5. Quinn runs OC-120 reconciliation/regression.
6. Elias finalizes OC-121 runbook semantics.
