# Execution-first run (2026-02-20 04:19 Europe/London)

Scope: all tasks currently in `in-progress`.

## Concrete advancement actions completed now

1. Implemented a platform unblock change in `PATCH /api/tasks/:id`:
   - Live-binding enforcement is now applied only when:
     - entering `in-progress`, or
     - changing owner while target status is `in-progress`.
   - Metadata-only updates (e.g., `github_url`, `tags`) on already in-progress tasks are now permitted without forcing active assignee heartbeat.

2. Posted execution-first progress comments on **every in-progress task** with:
   - current status,
   - explicit blocker owner,
   - next unblock step,
   - ETA,
   - branch/PR artifact pointer.

3. Re-validated OC-142 runtime context remains non-breaking (no active WhatsApp delivery path currently live), and escalated decision closure to owner.
