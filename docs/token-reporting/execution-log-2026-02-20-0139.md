# Execution log — 2026-02-20 01:39 Europe/London

## Concrete actions completed this run

1. Added ingestion endpoint `POST /api/reports/tokens/events` in `src/routes/reports.js`.
2. Added API docs for reports endpoints and event ingestion in `docs/api-reference.md`.
3. Added deterministic seeding utility `scripts/seed-token-usage-events.js`.
4. Executed seed utility successfully:
   - linked event id: 1 (task OC-117)
   - unlinked event id: 2

## Validation notes

- Direct DB seed succeeded (writes persisted to `data/dashboard.db`).
- Live dashboard API still returns zero totals until the running dashboard process reloads DB state (current process is holding in-memory sql.js state).

## Blocker ownership

- Atlas: restart dashboard service/process so seeded rows and new ingestion route are active in live API.
- Mason: replace bootstrap seed dependency by wiring real ingestion hook from OpenClaw telemetry path into `POST /api/reports/tokens/events` (or direct DB write path).
