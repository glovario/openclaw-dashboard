# Execution Run — 2026-02-20 03:59 Europe/London

## Scope
Execution-first pass over all tasks currently in `in-progress`.

## Concrete actions taken now

### OC-142 — WhatsApp plugin/channel binding drift
- Pulled live OpenClaw config via `gateway config.get`.
- Confirmed current state: `plugins.entries.whatsapp.enabled=false`, no active `channels.whatsapp` block, no WhatsApp binding under `bindings`.
- Pulled cron inventory via `cron list`; found no active cron delivery to WhatsApp channel, but several legacy payloads still mention WhatsApp destinations in free-text instructions.
- Action: prepared remediation recommendation to normalize legacy payload text to Telegram-only and keep plugin disabled until explicit relink decision.

### OC-116 — Finalize token usage schema + attribution contract
- Updated `docs/token-reporting/spec-addendum.md` with finalized contract clarifications:
  - explicit response field shapes
  - null normalization rules (`agent/model -> 'unknown'`)
  - UTC normalization for trend buckets
- This is PR-ready documentation advancement.

### OC-117 / OC-118 / OC-119 / OC-120 / OC-121 / OC-036
- Reviewed dependency graph (`GET /api/tasks/:id/dependencies`) and confirmed critical path:
  - OC-116 -> OC-117 -> OC-118 -> OC-119/OC-120/OC-121 -> OC-036
- Action: executed blocker escalation comments with explicit dependency owner and next unblock step per task (see dashboard comments posted in this run).
