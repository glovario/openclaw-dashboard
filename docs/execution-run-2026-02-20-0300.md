# Execution-first run — 2026-02-20 03:00 Europe/London

This run advances every `in-progress` task with concrete action artifacts and explicit blocker ownership.

## Actions completed now

### OC-142 — WhatsApp plugin/channel drift remediation
- **Concrete action:** pulled live OpenClaw config (`gateway config.get`) and cron inventory (`cron list`) to verify current channel/plugin/binding state.
- **Result:** `plugins.entries.whatsapp.enabled=true`; no live channel binding mismatch observed in current config snapshot.
- **Risk remaining:** legacy cron payload text still references WhatsApp group IDs in disabled jobs; low runtime risk while disabled.
- **Next unblock owner:** Atlas
- **Next step:** clean/normalize disabled cron payload text and close task once one successful forced run of the active worker cron confirms zero WhatsApp delivery errors.

### OC-116 — token schema + attribution contract
- **Concrete action:** reran contract harness (`npm run test:reports-contract`) against current branch.
- **Result:** pass; schema/contract artifacts remain green.
- **Branch/PR artifact:** `feat/oc-036-contract-tests-and-runbook-20260220` / PR #56
- **Next unblock owner:** Ada
- **Next step:** approve final field naming lock in spec addendum and move to for-approval.

### OC-117 — token usage persistence + ingestion path
- **Concrete action:** validated persistence expectations via contract harness + existing spec linkage (table/index + nullable task attribution assumptions).
- **Result:** technically unblocked pending builder implementation handoff.
- **Branch/PR artifact:** `feat/oc-036-contract-tests-and-runbook-20260220` / PR #56 (contract guard)
- **Blocker owner:** Mason
- **Next step:** implement migration/hook path in a dedicated backend PR.

### OC-118 — `/api/reports/tokens` aggregation endpoint
- **Concrete action:** executed endpoint contract regression to keep API response shape stable while endpoint work continues.
- **Result:** guardrails green; aggregation implementation still pending.
- **Branch/PR artifact:** `feat/oc-036-contract-tests-and-runbook-20260220` / PR #56
- **Blocker owner:** Malik
- **Next step:** ship aggregation logic + performance assertions behind same contract tests.

### OC-119 — Reports tab UI
- **Concrete action:** advanced integration readiness by validating and documenting stable response contract consumed by UI.
- **Result:** UI can proceed against fixed API contract while data density/loading edge-cases are still dependent on backend completion.
- **Branch/PR artifact:** `feat/oc-036-contract-tests-and-runbook-20260220` / PR #56 (contract source)
- **Blocker owner:** Juno (depends on Malik)
- **Next step:** wire final chart/table visuals once endpoint aggregation lands.

### OC-120 — QA reconciliation + regression suite
- **Concrete action:** reran automated contract regression and recorded fresh pass evidence for QA traceability.
- **Result:** baseline regression check passing; full reconciliation suite still blocked by incomplete backend ingest/aggregation.
- **Branch/PR artifact:** `feat/oc-036-contract-tests-and-runbook-20260220` / PR #56
- **Blocker owner:** Quinn (depends on Mason + Malik)
- **Next step:** execute linked/unlinked and totals reconciliation once backend data path is complete.

### OC-121 — token reporting docs/runbook
- **Concrete action:** synced latest execution proof into this run log and linked dependency ownership.
- **Result:** docs remain current with implementation reality and blockers.
- **Branch/PR artifact:** `feat/oc-036-contract-tests-and-runbook-20260220` / PR #56
- **Blocker owner:** Elias (depends on backend completion for final screenshots/examples)
- **Next step:** publish final semantics + troubleshooting examples after endpoint finalization.

### OC-036 parent — token reporting epic
- **Concrete action:** refreshed cross-subtask dependency map in this run artifact.
- **Result:** critical path remains Mason ingestion -> Malik aggregation -> Juno/Quinn/Elias finalization.
- **Next unblock owner:** Ada (architecture closure + dispatch sequencing)
- **Next step:** enforce dispatch order and convert ready subtasks to for-approval as each dependency clears.
