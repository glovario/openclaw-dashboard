# Execution Run — 2026-02-20 03:21 Europe/London

## Scope
Execution-first pass across all current `in-progress` dashboard tasks.

## Concrete advancement actions taken now

### OC-142 — WhatsApp plugin/channel binding drift
- Verified current gateway config state via `gateway config.get`:
  - `plugins.entries.whatsapp.enabled=false`
  - no active `channels.whatsapp` section present
  - active bindings are Telegram-only (`norman/ada/mason/atlas/bard`)
- Attempted cron inventory via tool (`cron.list`) to identify legacy WhatsApp-targeted jobs, but gateway timed out.
- Outcome: drift appears partially remediated in config; remaining risk is legacy cron payloads/channels.

### OC-116 — Token schema/attribution contract
- Updated `docs/token-reporting/spec-addendum.md` with:
  - explicit pricing assumptions (authoritative stored `cost_usd`, unknown-cost handling)
  - attribution linkage rules for deleted tasks
  - expanded acceptance checks for deleted-task and unknown-cost behavior

### OC-117 / OC-118 / OC-119 / OC-120 / OC-121 / OC-036
- Dependency graph refreshed and confirmed from API dependencies:
  - OC-117 depends on OC-116
  - OC-118 depends on OC-116 + OC-117
  - OC-119 depends on OC-118
  - OC-120 depends on OC-118 + OC-119
  - OC-121 depends on OC-116 + OC-118
  - OC-036 depends on all subtasks above
- Action in this run: posted explicit dependency-owner unblock steps on each task comment to force concrete next action and branch readiness.
