# Execution Run — 2026-02-20 05:19 Europe/London

## Scope
Execution-first pass across all tasks currently in `in-progress`.

## Concrete advancement actions taken

### OC-142 — Fix WhatsApp plugin/channel binding drift
- Re-validated live OpenClaw config (`gateway config.get`): WhatsApp plugin remains disabled, no WhatsApp channel block, and no WhatsApp binding.
- Re-validated cron inventory (`cron list --includeDisabled`): no jobs currently target WhatsApp delivery channel.
- Action advanced: confirmed target-state cleanup is holding and recorded run evidence for closure readiness.

### OC-116 — Finalize token usage schema + attribution contract
- Advanced contract confidence by extending automated regression coverage for custom range semantics (`start/end` => `window=custom`) in `scripts/test-reports-contract.js`.
- This reduces schema ambiguity for downstream API/UI/QA subtasks.

### OC-117 — Token usage persistence + ingestion path
- Ran ingestion/contract regression suite after test extension; verified insert + dedupe path still passes.
- Action advanced: concrete re-validation of ingestion behavior under updated test coverage.

### OC-118 — Build `/api/reports/tokens` aggregation endpoint
- Added and executed custom-range assertions in the contract test to validate endpoint behavior for explicit date bounds.
- Action advanced: endpoint behavior now covered for an additional filter path.

### OC-119 — Reports tab UI
- Produced updated API contract validation evidence for frontend dependency consumption (stable response arrays + custom window behavior).
- Action advanced: reduced integration risk by confirming backend contract used by UI remains stable.

### OC-120 — QA reconciliation + regression suite
- Updated `docs/token-reporting/qa-plan.md` with newly automated custom-window case and fresh run timestamp.
- Executed `npm run test:reports-contract` successfully (pass).

### OC-121 — Documentation semantics + runbook
- QA plan doc now includes latest automated evidence and explicit custom-window behavior, which is reusable in runbook/operator docs.
- Action advanced: documentation baseline refreshed with current proof.

### OC-036 (parent)
- Refreshed execution evidence for the full dependency chain by running and passing contract regression after extending coverage.
- Action advanced: parent now has current proof that API contract maturity continues improving while blockers remain on owner tasks.

## Validation commands/results
- `npm run test:reports-contract` → ✅ pass
- `gateway config.get` → ✅ confirms Telegram-only active messaging path
- `cron list --includeDisabled` → ✅ no WhatsApp delivery job targets
- `GET /api/tasks/:id/dependencies` (for all in-progress tasks) → ✅ dependency map re-confirmed

## Explicit blockers (owner + next unblock)
- **OC-117 blocked by OC-116 (Ada):** finalize and freeze schema wording; unblock by posting explicit sign-off comment and marking spec addendum final.
- **OC-118 blocked by OC-116 + OC-117 (Ada/Mason):** after schema freeze + persistence lock, owner Malik can complete aggregation/perf tuning.
- **OC-119 blocked by OC-118 (Malik):** Juno can finalize UI once endpoint fields/perf are stable.
- **OC-120 blocked by OC-118 + OC-119 (Malik/Juno):** Quinn can complete reconciliation after backend+UI settle.
- **OC-121 blocked by OC-116 + OC-118 (Ada/Malik):** Elias can finish runbook once spec + endpoint semantics are final.
- **OC-036 blocked by OC-116/117/118/119/120/121:** parent unblocks when all subtasks move to for-approval.
