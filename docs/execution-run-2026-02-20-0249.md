# Execution-first run (2026-02-20 02:49 Europe/London)

Scope: all tasks currently in `in-progress` from dashboard API.

## Concrete advancement actions completed now

1. Posted fresh execution-first progress comments on every in-progress task (OC-142, OC-116, OC-117, OC-118, OC-119, OC-120, OC-121, OC-036) including:
   - status snapshot
   - explicit blocker
   - dependency owner
   - next unblock step
   - ETA
   - PR/branch linkage or branch recommendation

2. Re-ran token reporting contract validation to keep implementation artifact current:
   - `npm run test:reports-contract` ✅ pass

## Escalated blockers (explicit owner + next step)

- **OC-142** — Owner: Atlas. Choose target policy (reactivate WhatsApp plugin/account vs remove WhatsApp channel/bindings + migrate crons), apply config, rerun affected crons.
- **OC-116** — Owner: Ada. Final schema/contract sign-off needed to release backend implementation chain.
- **OC-117** — Owner: Mason (depends on Ada). Start persistence migration branch immediately after OC-116 sign-off.
- **OC-118** — Owner: Malik (depends on Mason/Ada). Stage endpoint + contract test scaffold in parallel, finalize once OC-117 shape is stable.
- **OC-119** — Owner: Juno (depends on Malik). Keep UI wiring branch ready against mocked payload, then connect to stable API.
- **OC-120** — Owner: Quinn (depends on Malik/Juno). Stage regression harness now; execute at first stable API/UI handoff.
- **OC-121** — Owner: Elias (depends on Ada/Quinn). Prepare runbook skeleton and finalize with QA evidence.
- **OC-036 parent** — Owner: Ada/Norman orchestration. Close OC-116 then dispatch downstream in sequence.

## Notes

This run took direct advancement action on each in-progress task and kept noise consolidated to one operational summary.
