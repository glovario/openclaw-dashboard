# Execution Run — 2026-02-20 04:59 Europe/London

## Scope
All tasks currently in `in-progress` in dashboard.

## Concrete actions taken now

### OC-142 — Fix WhatsApp plugin/channel binding drift
- Updated legacy cron payloads that still referenced WhatsApp destinations:
  - `39775d49-fbbd-435b-b896-0cbee2df1412` (Morning overnight summary)
  - `17934db6-a74f-476b-9203-ad4a42b97bfd` (Himalaya inbox poll)
- Both payloads now target Telegram (`8444655188`) and no longer instruct WhatsApp delivery.
- Triggered forced run on both jobs for verification; both attempts timed out at gateway (verification blocked).

### OC-116 / OC-117 / OC-118 / OC-119 / OC-120 / OC-121 / OC-036
- Added explicit unblock matrix below and posted per-task progress comments with dependency owner + next unblock step.
- No safe cross-owner code change was applied in this runner pass to avoid violating ownership boundaries and one-task-one-PR discipline.

## Unblock matrix

| Task | Blocking dependency owner | Next unblock step |
|---|---|---|
| OC-116 | Malik (OC-118 endpoint contract) | Freeze response schema examples in OC-118 branch, then Ada finalizes contract acceptance checklist |
| OC-117 | Ada (OC-116 schema contract) | Ada signs schema/attribution contract, Mason proceeds with migration + ingestion hook wiring |
| OC-118 | Mason (OC-117 persistence layer) | Mason lands token usage table/indexes, then Malik wires aggregations + contract tests |
| OC-119 | Malik (OC-118 endpoint shape) | Malik publishes stable response fixtures, then Juno binds UI components |
| OC-120 | Malik + Juno (API + UI stabilization) | Wait for endpoint + UI fixture readiness, then Quinn executes full reconciliation regression |
| OC-121 | Ada + Quinn (semantics + QA evidence) | Ada/Quinn provide final metric semantics and signed QA outcomes, then Elias finalizes runbook language |
| OC-036 | Norman (orchestration) | Sequence: OC-116 -> OC-117 -> OC-118 -> OC-119 -> OC-120 -> OC-121 then parent closeout |

## Verification blockers
- `cron.run` for updated legacy jobs timed out due to gateway timeout (`ws://127.0.0.1:18789`, 60s).
- Dependency: Atlas to verify gateway responsiveness and rerun the two updated jobs.
