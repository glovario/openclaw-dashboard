# Execution Run — 2026-02-20 00:59 Europe/London

## Actions performed

1. Enhanced WhatsApp drift guard script to detect both binding schemas:
   - `routing.bindings[].to` (legacy)
   - `bindings[].match.channel` (current)
2. Added do-not-repeat ledger entry:
   - `docs/do-not-repeat-ledger.md`
3. Verified live OpenClaw config has no WhatsApp drift:
   - `node scripts/check-whatsapp-binding-drift.js /home/matt/.openclaw/openclaw.json`
   - Result: `ok: true`
4. Revalidated token reporting contract endpoint:
   - `API_KEY=*** node scripts/validate-token-reports.js`
   - Result: `ok: true` across 7/30/90 and include_unlinked filters.

## Impact

- OC-142 guard is now resilient to config shape drift and has explicit operator runbook steps.
- OC-036 stream remains technically unblocked at runtime API-contract level; remaining blockers are ownership/execution handoff on subtasks.
