# Execution Run — 2026-02-20 07:19 Europe/London

## Concrete advancement executed now
- Re-ran full reporting QA suite: `npm run test:reports-suite`.
- Result: **PASS** (contract + reconciliation).
- Confirmed active artifact branch/PR remains viable for child-task cherry-pick splits:
  - Branch: `chore/execution-run-2026-02-20-0559`
  - PR: https://github.com/glovario/openclaw-dashboard/pull/62

## Blocker escalations (owner-specific)
- OC-117 (Mason): needs dedicated PR split for persistence/ingestion.
- OC-118 (Malik): needs dedicated PR split + endpoint perf note.
- OC-119 (Juno): needs dedicated UI PR split + screenshot evidence.
- OC-120 (Quinn): needs explicit QA matrix sign-off comment.
- OC-121 (Elias): needs final docs acceptance comment + cross-link summary.

## Next unblock step
Owner PR-split wave this morning from the shared execution branch, followed by sign-off comments in each task thread.
