# Execution Run — 2026-02-20 07:09 Europe/London

Scope: forced execution-first advancement across every `in-progress` OC-036 task.
Branch: `chore/execution-run-2026-02-20-0559`

## Concrete advancement applied now

### OC-116 (spec)
- Reused finalized schema addendum + acceptance checklist (`docs/token-reporting/spec-addendum.md`) as active source of truth.
- Action: posted explicit progress + unblock signal to downstream owners.

### OC-117 (persistence + ingestion)
- Verified ingestion endpoint and dedupe regression are passing in suite.
- Action: posted status with branch/test evidence and requested owner handoff for final sign-off + PR split.

### OC-118 (aggregation endpoint)
- Verified `/api/reports/tokens` contract + reconciliation automated and green.
- Action: posted status with concrete evidence and residual dependency (owner-driven PR cut).

### OC-119 (Reports tab UI)
- Implemented concrete UI advancement in `client/src/components/ReportsTab.jsx`:
  - custom date range support (`window=custom`, `start/end`)
  - trend visualization (daily token bars)
  - top models list
  - explicit empty states for KPI/table/chart surfaces
- Validation: `npm run test:reports-suite && npm run build` ✅

### OC-120 (QA reconciliation)
- QA scripts already present and green in this run.
- Action: posted rerun evidence and requested Quinn sign-off artifact attachment.

### OC-121 (docs/runbook)
- Existing semantics + runbook docs already in place under `docs/token-reporting/`.
- Action: posted ready-for-review note and specific delta requested from docs owner (publish summary in task comment).

### OC-036 (parent)
- Posted parent rollup with child status, blockers, and next owner actions.

## Residual blockers (explicit)
- Branch/PR ownership is still fragmented by designated owners (Ada/Mason/Malik/Juno/Quinn/Elias). This run advanced implementation artifacts and evidence, but final per-task PR split must be cut by assigned owners to satisfy one-task-one-PR governance.
