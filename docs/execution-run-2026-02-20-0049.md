# Execution Run — 2026-02-20 00:49 Europe/London

## Concrete advancement performed

1. Restarted dashboard process on `:3420` to load current backend routes after detecting stale runtime behavior.
2. Restarted again with explicit `DASHBOARD_API_KEY` to restore expected API auth key continuity.
3. Revalidated `/api/reports/tokens` endpoint and contract suite:
   - `curl ... /api/reports/tokens?window=7` now returns JSON (not SPA HTML)
   - `node scripts/validate-token-reports.js` returns `{ ok: true }`
4. Rechecked WhatsApp drift against live config:
   - `node scripts/check-whatsapp-binding-drift.js /home/matt/.openclaw/openclaw.json`
   - Result: `ok:true`, no plugin/channel/binding drift.

## Branch artifact

- Branch: `chore/oc-036-142-execution-pass-2026-02-20`
- This run adds operational evidence for OC-036 and OC-142 blockers.

## Impact on in-progress tasks

- **OC-118 / OC-119 / OC-120 / OC-121 / OC-036**: primary blocker (`/api/reports/tokens` route failure at runtime) is now cleared at runtime; implementation can proceed from a working API path.
- **OC-142**: drift check validated clean state; remaining work is close-out evidence + prevention guard (added to do-not-repeat ledger).
