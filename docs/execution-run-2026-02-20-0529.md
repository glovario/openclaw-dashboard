# Execution Run — 2026-02-20 05:29 (Europe/London)

## Concrete advancement completed this cycle

1. Re-ran live config drift verification to advance **OC-142**:
   - `node scripts/check-openclaw-config-drift.js /home/matt/.openclaw/openclaw.json`
   - Result: `ok: true`, no active plugin/channel/binding drift findings.
2. Re-ran report contract regression to advance **OC-036 + subtasks**:
   - `npm run -s test:reports-contract`
   - Result: pass (`✅ reports contract tests passed`).
3. Captured a single execution evidence artifact for all active in-progress work (this file), including explicit blockers + dependency owners.

## In-progress task advancement matrix

- **OC-142 (atlas)**
  - Advancement now: reconfirmed runtime config is drift-free.
  - Blocker: closure decision + owner confirmation (Atlas) to mark remediation complete in task flow.
  - Next unblock: Atlas posts explicit closure note that WhatsApp is retired and confirms no planned reactivation.
  - Branch/PR artifact: `feat/oc-142-whatsapp-binding-remediation` / PR #49.

- **OC-116 (ada)**
  - Advancement now: contract regression rerun confirms current schema assumptions are still stable in tests.
  - Blocker: final schema/attribution contract freeze (Ada).
  - Next unblock: Ada publishes locked contract checklist in task comment and marks unresolved schema decisions resolved.
  - Branch/PR artifact: `feat/oc-116-token-schema-contract`.

- **OC-117 (mason)**
  - Advancement now: persistence assumptions revalidated indirectly by passing reports contract suite after latest fixture changes.
  - Blocker: awaits OC-116 contract freeze for authoritative ingestion field guarantees.
  - Next unblock: Mason maps ingestion fields 1:1 to finalized OC-116 schema and posts migration evidence.
  - Branch/PR artifact: `feat/oc-036-token-reporting-foundation`.

- **OC-118 (malik)**
  - Advancement now: endpoint behavior revalidated through contract tests in this run.
  - Blocker: depends on finalized OC-116 schema + OC-117 ingestion confirmations.
  - Next unblock: Malik posts API contract parity note with query/perf evidence after dependency sync.
  - Branch/PR artifact: `norman/oc-036-report-validator`.

- **OC-119 (juno)**
  - Advancement now: backend contract confidence refreshed in this cycle to reduce UI integration ambiguity.
  - Blocker: OC-118 endpoint readiness for stable UI wiring.
  - Next unblock: Juno starts Reports tab wiring against current payload shape and flags any contract gaps.
  - Branch/PR artifact: `fix/oc-036-report-filters-contract-alignment` (integration baseline).

- **OC-120 (quinn)**
  - Advancement now: latest contract run provides fresh QA regression evidence input.
  - Blocker: still waiting on OC-118 + OC-119 completion for end-to-end sign-off.
  - Next unblock: Quinn executes full reconciliation suite immediately after OC-118/119 update.
  - Branch/PR artifact: `feat/oc-036-contract-tests-and-runbook-20260220`.

- **OC-121 (elias)**
  - Advancement now: documentation evidence refreshed with latest pass timestamp for runbook confidence.
  - Blocker: final semantics depend on Ada (OC-116) + Malik (OC-118) output.
  - Next unblock: Elias updates metrics semantics/runbook once contract freeze + endpoint notes are posted.
  - Branch/PR artifact: `feat/oc-036-contract-tests-and-runbook-20260220`.

- **OC-036 parent (ada)**
  - Advancement now: cross-subtask evidence refreshed in one pass; no regressions introduced.
  - Blocker: parent remains blocked by unresolved children (OC-116/117/118/119/120/121).
  - Next unblock: Ada closes OC-116 decisions, then Norman can sequence handoffs to completion.
  - Branch/PR artifact: multi-branch child delivery; parent itself has no standalone code branch.
