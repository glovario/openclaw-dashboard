# Execution Run — 2026-02-20 01:49 (Europe/London)

## Scope
Execution-first advancement pass across all in-progress dashboard tasks.

## Concrete actions performed now

### OC-142 — WhatsApp plugin/channel drift
- Re-ran runtime drift verifier:
  - `node scripts/check-whatsapp-binding-drift.js /home/matt/.openclaw/openclaw.json`
- Result: `drift=[]`, `pluginEnabled=true`, `channelEnabled=false`, `whatsappBindingCount=0`.
- Advancement: evidence refreshed; no unsafe config mutation needed this pass.

### OC-116 / OC-036 stream — token reporting contract readiness
- Ran contract validator script against live dashboard API:
  - `OPENCLAW_DASHBOARD_API_KEY=*** node scripts/validate-token-reports.js`
- Result: all checks passed (`window=7/30/90`, `include_unlinked=false`, reconciliation checks).
- Advancement: verification evidence captured for spec/endpoint handoff.
