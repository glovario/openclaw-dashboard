# Execution Run — 2026-02-20 06:49 Europe/London

## Branch artifact
- Branch: `chore/execution-run-2026-02-20-0559`
- Commit pending in this run:
  - `src/routes/reports.js`
  - `scripts/test-reports-contract.js`

## Concrete advancement completed now

1) Hardened reporting API custom-range validation (supports OC-118/OC-120)
- Added request validation in `GET /api/reports/tokens`:
  - invalid `start` timestamp -> `400`
  - invalid `end` timestamp -> `400`
  - `start > end` range -> `400`
- This prevents silent bad filters and improves QA determinism.

2) Extended contract test coverage (supports OC-120)
- Updated `scripts/test-reports-contract.js` to assert:
  - invalid `start` returns `400`
  - inverted range (`start > end`) returns `400`

3) Verification evidence run
- `node scripts/test-reports-contract.js` ✅
- `node scripts/test-reports-reconciliation.js` ✅

## Task-by-task action/blocker status

### OC-116 (Ada) — Finalize schema + attribution contract
- Action this run: applied implementation-aligned contract hardening in API and test coverage so schema contract now rejects invalid custom date ranges.
- Blocker/dependency owner: none hard blocker on this run.
- Next unblock step: Ada to publish final schema/contract sign-off note referencing new validation behavior.

### OC-117 (Mason) — Persistence + ingestion path
- Action this run: validated downstream contract stability with ingestion+report contract tests passing.
- Blocker/dependency owner: depends on OC-116 final schema ratification (owner: Ada).
- Next unblock step: once OC-116 sign-off lands, Mason can close any remaining ingestion edge mapping gaps.

### OC-118 (Malik) — Aggregation endpoint
- Action this run: shipped endpoint guardrails for custom-range validation + test coverage.
- Blocker/dependency owner: partially blocked by OC-116 schema final sign-off (owner: Ada).
- Next unblock step: Malik to confirm endpoint fields against final OC-116 contract and move to review.

### OC-119 (Juno) — Reports tab UI
- Action this run: preserved API response stability and improved error behavior for invalid custom ranges; enables deterministic UI error states.
- Blocker/dependency owner: blocked by OC-118 endpoint completion (owner: Malik).
- Next unblock step: Juno to wire and verify invalid-range UX once OC-118 branch is linked in task.

### OC-120 (Quinn) — QA reconciliation + regression
- Action this run: added 2 new regression assertions and executed both report validation suites successfully.
- Blocker/dependency owner: blocked by OC-118 and OC-119 finalization (owners: Malik/Juno).
- Next unblock step: Quinn to run full UI+API matrix after OC-119 lands.

### OC-121 (Elias) — Docs + runbook
- Action this run: produced this execution evidence note and updated validation behavior details for handoff.
- Blocker/dependency owner: waits for final OC-116 + OC-118 contract freeze (owners: Ada/Malik).
- Next unblock step: Elias to fold new custom-range validation semantics into runbook/API reference.

### OC-036 (Parent)
- Action this run: concrete implementation and tests advanced under child tasks (OC-118/OC-120), with branch artifact updated.
- Blocker/dependency owner: parent remains blocked until OC-116..OC-121 complete.
- Next unblock step: owners close child tasks in dependency order; then move OC-036 to review.
